Millions of individuals in India with speech and language impairments, caused by conditions like autism, aphasia, or cognitive disabilities, face immense challenges in basic communication. Implementation of advances in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems in India is limited. 

The proposed solution is an application designed to convert English sentences into a sequence of meaningful pictograms, facilitating communication for individuals with speech and language impairments. The app will focus on breaking down complex text into simpler visual representations that are easy to understand and use in daily conversations. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLMs the app will ensure that users receive accurate and contextually appropriate pictograms for their intended messages. The application will be intuitive, accessible, and customizable to cater to individual needs, ensuring that it addresses the communication barriers faced by people with disabilities. Additional features, such as speech-to-picto conversion, customization for regional languages, and interactive tutorials, will enhance its usability, making the app an essential tool for those who struggle with traditional communication methods.

Audience:

1. Individuals with speech and language impairments – People suffering from aphasia, autism, or other cognitive disabilities.


2. Caregivers and healthcare providers – Those working with individuals who need alternative communication tools to aid in daily interactions.


3. Special education teachers – Educators who work with students with communication challenges.


4. Speech-language pathologists – Professionals who support language development in individuals with impairments.



Data Sets:

Pictogram libraries – Open-source databases of pictograms.
In specific we are using the ARSAAC API. (URL: https://arasaac.org/)

Text-to-pictogram mappings – Annotated datasets mapping sentences to corresponding pictograms.

Lexical simplification datasets – Data for simplifying complex text into easier, pictogram-friendly forms.
In specific we are using the BenchLS dataset for Lexical Simplification. (URL: https://zenodo.org/records/2552393)
